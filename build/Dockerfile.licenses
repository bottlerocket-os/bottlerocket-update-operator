# This Dockerfile produces an image that has only the licenses of dependencies
# used in the update operator.
#
# LICENSE, and other legal notices, are collected by bottlerocket-license-scan
# to be organized into a project-wide conventional directory structure rooted at
# /licenses in the resulting image.

# SDK_IMAGE is the Bottlerocket SDK container image that provides
# `bottlerocket-license-scan` in it.
#
# Generally, this will track the value of BUILDSYS_SDK_IMAGE provided in
# Bottlerocket's Makefile.toml:
#
# https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/blob/develop/Makefile.toml
#
# For example, see this line in Makefile.toml:
#
# https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/blob/a1d098dcd9908e3db1dc290ed9dad53e6f8fe44c/Makefile.toml#L31

# GOLANG_IMAGE is the image to be used for collecting modules. This should be
# the same image used in the build. The idea is to have the same toolchain to
# avoid running into any differences between versions.
